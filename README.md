# SoapBox
Possibly a too cutesy chat app

## To Run
```
npm install
node index.js
```

## In-Chat Instructions

While you're in the app, you can change your nickname (as long as it doesn't already exist) and nickname color. The nickname color, however, is denoted by the border around your nickname.

This is done with `/nick <name>` and `/nickcolor <color>` respectively.

## Some Sad Stuff
- Scrolling doesn't work on Firefox
- No real persistence
- Escape characters are not cute
- Chatbox boxes will not shrink until you create more boxes
